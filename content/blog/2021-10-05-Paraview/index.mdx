Paraview is free software that can be used to visualise both observational and numerical data.
It has been used by in many different research fields as illustrated in Figure 1, where we see the Paraview applied in cosmology (Fig1 (a)) and in medical research (Fig1 (b))
Paraview can readily render the images based on the research data , facilitating visualization of the data from different perspectives by rotating and also post- processing the original data.
Thereby, this software offers the necessary tools to create some high-quality images, which not only gives support to explain your research but it also can help your work gain visibility.
There are several examples of data visualization with Paraview which can be found in [Paraview's gallery](https://www.paraview.org/gallery/)

One of the main reasons Paraview is so popular is that it offers the possibility of doing analyses and images even without programming.
Everything can be done interactively, and there is a vast documentation on it, so Paraview is very user-friendly.
That quality can be quite handy when it comes to young PhD researchers with little background in programming.

To start with Paraview, you should first download the [most recent version of Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download)

The main type of file paraview reads is the vtk files. It is quite straightforward to write an output in vtk from any software or code and there are plenty of examples online.
But Paraview can also read different files extensions, including the type of files mostly used in flows simulations.
Therefore, if you have a file that paraview has a reader for, you can just open and select the reader as shown in Figure (2) and paraview will promptly process your data.
